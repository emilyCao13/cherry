# Cherry! üçí
### An aesthetic pomodoro timer app with built in to-do list

---
## The development process:
The idea for this project was created in late July 2023 as a way for me to self-learn and practice web-development skills using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
The name was inspired by cherry tomatoes üçíüçÖ.
The main functionings of the timer and to-do list were finished in mid-September 2023, with plans for further improvements over time.
As of now, this application is able to be used for pomodoro studying or working, as well as the to-do list to keep track of your tasks!

## Instructions:
Check out the website at https://emilycao13.github.io/cherry/. The pomodoro timer is set to 25 minutes, the short break is set to 5 minutes, and the long break is set to 15 minutes.
There is also a Spotify playlist with peaceful music embedded if you wish to play it. 

The pomodoro study method is a useful technique to help with focusing on work and efficiently studying. Utilize the to-do list before beginning your pomodoro session,
listing out the tasks you wish to accomplish. Next, choose a task to focus on and begin the pomodoro timer. For the duration of this time, put away anything else and solely work towards
the designated task until the end of the timer. If you finish early, start on the next task. Ideally you want to be productive for the entirety of this session.

After this, the timer will transition to a short break in which you are free to do whatever you would like before starting on another pomodoro. After 4 pomodoros, it will 
transition into a long break, your pomodoro progress is tracked on the progress bar located above the timer itself.

## Future update goals:
- Adding a settings feature to allow for customized times and themes
- Adding an ending screen showcasing the finished tasks, what tasks are left, and congratulations
- Allowing for one session to go through more than 4 pomodoros
